## üîÅ Workflow Behaviour

You must adhere to the following principles in all task execution:

### 1. **Create an Issue**
Before starting any change, if an issue does not exist create a GitHub issue:
- Title it clearly
- Describe what you intend to do
- Assign the issue to yourself (`@me`)

### 2. **Document Intent**
Review the issue, relevant sub-issues, and any comments:
- Where you have been asked to work on a parent issue, or epic - make sure to select the next logical sub issue and continue work (and updates) in that sub issue
- Read and understand what is required, review code as needed - and then document your intentions in a comment and add taht to the issue. You must not proceed to work without documenting your intent.
- Confirm you intent comment is attached to the issue correctly, then commence work.

### 3. **Log Progress**
At every significant step:
- Comment in the issue with your action or decision
- Include links to research, relevant code, or output
- If interrupted, the issue must contain everything required to resume

### 4a. **Unable to resolve**
If you are unable to resolve the issue:
- Comment in the issue with your action or decision
- Label the issue as "needs-help" (create the label if it doesn't exist)
- Once you have confirmed the above - end your turn.

### 4b. **Create a Pull Request**
When ready:
- Push your changes to a branch named `codex/issue-###-description`
- Open a pull request referencing the issue
- Assign it to the relevant CODEOWNER, defaulting to `@troykelly` for review
- Use clear titles and summaries

### 5. **Follow Best Practices**
You must:
- Use clear, typed code
- Align with existing style guides
- Include inline comments where reasoning is complex
- Include error handling and validation where applicable
- Always provide comprehensive tests

---

## üîê Sensitive Info Handling

- Do **not** commit or expose secrets.
- If needed, load environment variables via `.env` or injected shell.
- Always use `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive/generated files.

## üóÇÔ∏è  GitHub Issue & Sub-Issue Management Cookbook

The worker automates planning via GitHub issues rather than an external tracker.
Below are the **battle-tested commands, GraphQL mutations and patterns** we now use so
future agents don‚Äôt need to rediscover them.

### 1. Creating issues (REST/GraphQL)

*CLI (`gh`):*

```bash
# Open a new issue in the current repository
gh issue create --title "My task" --body "Details‚Ä¶" --label enhancement
```

*GraphQL (`createIssue` mutation ‚Äì useful from scripts/Python):*

```graphql
mutation ($repoId: ID!, $title: String!, $body: String!) {
  createIssue(input: {repositoryId: $repoId, title: $title, body: $body}) {
    issue { id number url }
  }
}
```

### 2. Parent ‚áÑ child (sub-issue) links

GitHub added first-class hierarchical issue relationships in 2024.  The GraphQL
API exposes them via the **`addSubIssue`** and **`removeSubIssue`** mutations.

```graphql
# Link an existing child issue to a parent (epic)
mutation ($issueId: ID!, $subIssueId: ID!) {
  addSubIssue(input: {issueId: $issueId, subIssueId: $subIssueId}) {
    issue     { number }
    subIssue  { number }
  }
}

# To unlink
mutation ($issueId: ID!, $subIssueId: ID!) {
  removeSubIssue(input: {issueId: $issueId, subIssueId: $subIssueId}) {
    issue { number }
  }
}
```

Notes:
1. `issueId` is always the **parent** ID.
2. Either `subIssueId` **or** `subIssueUrl` can be supplied.
3. REST equivalents do not yet exist (as of 2025-06).

### 3. Dependency links (blocks / blocked-by / relates-to)

While the UI supports these terms, the public API is still experimental.  Until
formal support lands, encode dependencies directly in the issue **body** (as we
do above) or reference them via keywords such as `blocked by #123`.

### 4. Handy `gh` helpers

```bash
# View an issue including its sub-issues in the browser
gh issue view 42 --web

# List all open issues with the epic hierarchy column
gh issue list --label epic -L 100

# Close with comment
gh issue close 42 --comment "Fixed by #99"
```

### 5. Example ‚Äì scripted creation & linking

```python
import os, requests, textwrap, json

token = os.environ['GITHUB_TOKEN']
headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}", "Content-Type": "application/json"}

# 1. create parent epic
create = """
mutation($repo:ID!,$title:String!,$body:String!){
  createIssue(input:{repositoryId:$repo,title:$title,body:$body}){issue{id number}}
}"""

# ‚Ä¶ obtain repoId first ‚Ä¶
repoId = "R_xxx"  # via a separate query
parent = requests.post("https://api.github.com/graphql",
                       json={"query": create,
                             "variables": {"repo": repoId, "title": "Epic", "body": "‚Ä¶"}},
                       headers=headers).json()["data"]["createIssue"]["issue"]

# 2. create child
child = requests.post("https://api.github.com/graphql",
                      json={"query": create,
                            "variables": {"repo": repoId, "title": "Task", "body": "‚Ä¶"}},
                      headers=headers).json()["data"]["createIssue"]["issue"]

# 3. link
link = """
mutation($issueId:ID!,$subIssueId:ID!){
  addSubIssue(input:{issueId:$issueId, subIssueId:$subIssueId}){issue{subIssueCount}}
}"""
requests.post("https://api.github.com/graphql", json={"query": link,
          "variables": {"issueId": parent["id"], "subIssueId": child["id"]}}, headers=headers)
```

### 6. Rate-limits & error handling

* GraphQL mutations count toward the 5,000 requests/hr authenticated limit.
* Check `errors` key in the JSON response ‚Äì mutations return HTTP 200 even on
  logical failure.

### 7. When to mutate vs. use `gh`

| Need                                           | Recommended tool |
|------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| One-off manual triage                          | GitHub UI / `gh issue` |
| Bulk creation / linking (scripts/pipelines)    | GraphQL API      |
| CI checks (e.g., ensure sub-issues closed)     | GraphQL query    |

## üõ†Ô∏è  Working a Single Existing Issue

When the agent is launched with **just a GitHub issue number**, follow this
check-list:

1. **Self-assign**
   ```bash
   gh issue edit <num> --add-assignee @me
   ```

2. **Read the context** ‚Äì review the issue body and *all* comments.

3. **Acknowledge with a plan** ‚Äì add a public comment such as:
   > Working on this now ‚Äì plan: update module X, add tests Y/Z, open PR.

4. **Implement**
   ‚Ä¢ Create branch `codex/issue-<num>-<slug>`
   ‚Ä¢ Commit code/tests/docs with `Fixes #<num>` in the message.

5. **Pull Request**
   ```bash
   gh pr create \
      --head codex/issue-<num>-<slug> \
      --title "fix: <summary> (closes #<num>)" \
      --body  "Summary of changes‚Ä¶" \
      --reviewer $(grep -oE "@[^ ]+" CODEOWNERS 2>/dev/null | paste -sd, -) || @troykelly
   ```

6. **Blocked?**
   ‚Ä¢ If unable to proceed, comment why, what was tried, and what information is needed.  
   ‚Ä¢ Remain assigned so the waiting state is visible.

7. **Complete** ‚Äì after the PR merges and CI passes, ensure the issue is closed automatically (via commit/PR keywords) or close it manually with a brief confirmation.

## üìù Reviewing & Refining a User-Submitted Issue

When the agent‚Äôs job is to *curate* an issue (rewrite metadata and create
sub-tasks), use this workflow:

1. **Assign & acknowledge**
   ```bash
   gh issue edit <num> --add-assignee @me
   gh issue comment <num> --body "Reviewing issue now; will restructure and break into tasks."
   ```

2. **Analyse the request** ‚Äì study the problem, goals and constraints. Decide
   whether the issue is an **epic** that needs decomposition.

3. **Rewrite the issue**
   ```bash
   gh issue edit <num> \
     --title "feat: <concise, action-oriented title>" \
     --body-file curated_body.md \
     --add-label epic,enhancement
   ```
   * Title: imperative & scoped.
   * Body: include sections *Problem*, *Goal*, *Acceptance Criteria*.
   * Labels: add / remove to reflect new scope.

4. **Create & link sub-issues** (for each discrete work item):
   ```bash
   child=$(gh issue create --title "task: implement X" --body "‚Ä¶" --label task --json id,number)
   gh api graphql -f query='mutation($p:ID!,$c:ID!){addSubIssue(input:{issueId:$p,subIssueId:$c}){issue{id}}}' \
     -f p=$(gh issue view <num> --json id -q .id) \
     -f c=$(echo $child | jq -r '.id')
   ```

5. **Summarise** ‚Äì comment listing new title/labels and the sub-issues created:
   > Updated metadata; spawned #123 #124 for implementation & tests.

6. **Hand-off** ‚Äì unassign yourself from the epic if you will not execute the
   implementation so the scheduler can pick up child tasks.
