# Apply Ruff (https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) linting across the repository.

# The existing code-base predates strict Ruff compliance and deliberately
# deviates from a handful of default *pycodestyle* conventions (for instance
# long explanatory comments often exceed 79 characters, and certain Home
# Assistant helper imports are intentionally placed further down in the module
# after *voluptuous* schema definitions).  To avoid an invasive re-formatting
# churn we opt-out of the relevant error codes for now.
#
# The CI workflow can be tightened in future once the offending sections have
# been refactored.
line-length = 120
# Enable the full *pycodestyle* and *pyflakes* rule sets.
select = ["E", "F", "W"]
# Temporarily silence:
#   E501 – line length > 79 characters (handled via *line-length* above)
#   E402 – module-level import not at top of file (accepted pattern in HA)
