# Media Browsing

Home Assistant exposes a generic **Browse Media** dialog which integrations can
hook into to provide a rich navigation tree.  As of version `0.6.0` the Emby
integration fully implements this capability through the
`media_player.async_browse_media` API.

---

## Quick start

1. Open the left-hand **Media** panel in Home Assistant.
2. Click **Browse media** then pick any Emby player entity.
3. Choose a library (Movies, TV Shows, Music, ‚Ä¶).
4. Drill down into collections / folders until you reach a playable item.
5. Hit the artwork tile to start playback instantly on the selected client.

## Hierarchy mapping

| Emby Object            | HA `media_class`            | `can_play` | `can_expand` |
|------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|--------------|
| Library (View)         | `directory`                 | ‚ùå         | ‚úÖ           |
| Collection / Folder    | `directory`                 | ‚ùå         | ‚úÖ           |
| TV Season              | `season`                    | ‚ùå         | ‚úÖ           |
| Movie                  | `movie`                     | ‚úÖ         | ‚ùå           |
| Episode                | `episode`                   | ‚úÖ         | ‚ùå           |
| Music Album            | `album`                     | ‚úÖ         | ‚úÖ (tracks)  |
| Song / Track           | `music`                     | ‚úÖ         | ‚ùå           |
| Playlist               | `playlist`                  | ‚úÖ         | ‚ùå           |

The integration translates Emby item types into the closest matching Home
Assistant `media_class` so the frontend can decorate each tile appropriately.

## Supported play commands

When you tap **Play** on a leaf node the UI triggers `media_player.play_media`
with an **enqueue** mode that follows the new Home Assistant 2024.11 API:

* **Play now** ‚Äì `enqueue: play` (default)
* **Play next** ‚Äì `enqueue: next`
* **Add to queue** ‚Äì `enqueue: add`

Under the hood the Emby backend translates these modes to the corresponding
queue operations so behaviour is identical to the Emby web client.  If your
Home Assistant version predates 2024.11 the integration silently falls back to
legacy boolean semantics (`enqueue: true / false`) so existing automations
keep working.

---

## Pagination

To keep the Browse dialog responsive the integration fetches library children
in **pages of 100 items**.  When a folder contains more entries a virtual
`Next ‚ñ∏` tile appears at the bottom (and a `‚óÇ Prev` tile when you are not on
the first page).  This pattern mirrors the Plex and Jellyfin integrations and
ensures large collections ‚Äì for example a 50,000-track music library ‚Äì load in
milliseconds.

Pagination is completely transparent to service calls: the `media_content_id`
for a given item is **stable** regardless of which page it was found on.

---

## Deep linking & automations

Every tile in the browse tree exposes a stable `media_content_id` that starts
with the custom schema `emby://`.  Example:

```
emby://item/9d2c6723d5c175afcd9f5e9d1f4b5678
```

You can copy this ID (e.g. via automation UI) and feed it directly into
`media_player.play_media` ‚Äì either manually or programmatically ‚Äì to trigger
playback without going through the browse dialog.

```yaml
service: media_player.play_media
target:
  entity_id: media_player.emby_projector
data:
  media_type: movie
  media_id: "emby://item/9d2c6723d5c175afcd9f5e9d1f4b5678"
```

---

## Mixing in other sources

When the requested ID starts with `media-source://` the Emby integration
delegates the call back to the built-in `media_source` integration so local
files, TTS and cloud providers keep working as expected.  This means you can
seamlessly blend local jingles or announcements into your Emby driven
automations.

---

## Troubleshooting

‚Ä¢ *Item not found* ‚Äì The associated Emby item has been deleted or is no longer
  accessible to the user configured in the integration.  Re-scan libraries or
  regenerate the link via the browse dialog.
‚Ä¢ *Empty library* ‚Äì Ensure the user account used by Home Assistant has
  permission to view the libraries in Emby server settings.

For further assistance please open an issue on GitHub with debug logs
(`logger: components.emby: debug`).
