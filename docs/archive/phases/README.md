# Archived Phase Documentation

This directory contains historical phase-based task documentation that was used during initial development of the integration.

**As of November 2024, all work is now tracked via GitHub Issues and the Project Board.**

See: https://github.com/users/troykelly/projects/3

## Why Archived?

The project has migrated to issue-driven development where:
- All work items are GitHub Issues
- Progress is tracked on the Project Board
- CI automatically triages new issues
- Issues auto-close when PRs merge

## Contents

| File | Description |
